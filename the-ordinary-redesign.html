        <h1>The Ordinary Website Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to The Ordinary brand and website</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2013, The Ordinary is a beauty and makeup brand from the parent company DECIEM. As stated in their statement: “The Ordinary is clinical formulations with integrity,” The Ordinary’s mission is to make clinical ingredients that only available in high-end skincare products accessible to a wide range of customers while still being transparent and honest. The brand’s target audience are women of all ages and class who are into skincare and affordable products that are free from unnecessary and harmful chemicals.
        </p>

        <h2>The current state of The Ordinary website</h2>
        <p>
            The current state of The Ordinary’s website is very simple, which I believe to have successfully conveyed the feeling that The Ordinary is an affordable brand. However, since the current website is too simple, it does not look attractive to the customers, and it does not engage the customers to interact with the site. Some of the weaknesses of the current website include:
        </p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>
                The navigation bar, and the reason for this is that its categories are not friendly to people who are new to skincare or are unfamiliar to The Ordinary’s products
            </li>
            <li>
                The product page layout, which only consists of lengthy paragraphs and does not look interesting
            </li>
            <li>
                The home page, which also does not look compelling due to the lack of content
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Immediate goals</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the identified weaknesses. I came up with three immediate goals for the redesigned site:
        </p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>
                To have a new navigation bar that divides products into categories that people who are new to skincare and unfamiliar with the brand can easily understand and navigate
            </li>
            <li>
                To have a new home page that promotes either the brand’s newest product or one of the brand’s best-seller
            </li>
            <li>
                To have a new product page layout that highlights the benefits of each product
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The card sort excercise</h2>
        <p class="card-sort">
            Before doing the card sort exercise, I came up with different key terms for my participants to sort out. A majority of these terms were formed by breaking The Ordinary’s products into groups based on their functions in the skincare and makeup routines. Others were formed based on the information about the brand and the product guides available on the current website.
        </p>
        <figure class="main-images" id="card-sort-image">
            <img src="images/the-ordinary-redesign/data.jpg" alt="Card sort exercise data">
            <figcaption>Card sort data</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="card-sort">
            Base on the data collected from the card sort exercise, I could see that a majority of my participants thought that the new website should have five different categories, which are “skincare,” “makeup,” “hair care,” “product guides,” and “about.” I also asked my participants to rank the importance of each category, and most of them agreed that “skincare” was the most important one, followed by “makeup,” “hair care,” “product guides,” and “about.”
        </p>
        <p class="card-sort">
            After analyzing the results that I got from my participants, I decided to go with the decisions that the majority of my participants made. Since it was what made the most sense to my participants, I believe it will make the most sense to the site’s customers.
        </p>
