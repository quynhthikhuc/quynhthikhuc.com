            My interest in front-end development started when I was at Camden County College, studying Graphic Design. After taking a basic web authoring class, I realized my passion for coding, especially front-end coding. As a result, after getting my associate degree, I applied to the Interactive Digital Media major at Drexel University to pursue my passion for front-end development.

            I'm confident in using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. While I have not had a whole lot of experience in web development and front-end development yet, I'm willing to learn, and I'm currently putting my best effort into improving my coding skills!

            I love travelling, and I always try my best to travel at least once or twice a year. However, when I don't have a lot of free time on my hand, I usually just stay indoors and watch Netflix or play The Sims 4. Sometimes, when the weather is nice, I also enjoy taking my camera with me and strolling around Philadelphia.
